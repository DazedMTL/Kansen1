Saeki, who nodded silently, nodded back at me.[l][er]
I opened the door halfway and stuck my head into Class H.[pcms]

Well, there's no way there are ghosts or anything...[l][er]
It's just my made-up story...[pcms]

I confirmed that there were no living humans, and I pulled[r]my head out from the gap in the door.[pcms]

Saeki took a deep breath at my words and returned her face[r]to its usual expression, no longer showing fear or tension.[pcms]

Should we change locations...?[l][er]
Well then, let's go.[pcms]

We moved away from Class H and started to make our way back[r]along the path we came.[pcms]

The third floor corridor seems to have a somewhat different[r]atmosphere and air compared to the second floor corridor[r]that we always see.[pcms]

*4776|
[fc]
It feels like we have gained an advantage, perhaps because[r]we are on the top floor or because we feel superior to the[r]people on the lower floors.[pcms]

We're at the very top![pcms]

It's like a small child who has climbed to the highest point[r]of a playground.[pcms]

*4778|
[fc]
As Saeki looked at me, who was speaking with determination,[r]she smiled softly.[l][er]
That smile of hers made my heart beat a little faster.[pcms]

*4779|
[fc]
Saeki, she's cute when she smiles...[l][er]
I didn't realize it because I hardly ever saw her smile...[pcms]

*4780|
[fc]
There might be other men who have noticed this, besides[r]myself.[pcms]

*4781|
[fc]
Thinking that way, I felt a little frustrated.[l][er]
If possible, I wanted to keep it as my own secret, that's[r]what I thought.[pcms]

While walking in the third floor corridor, I remembered[r]something.[pcms]

*4784|
[fc]
In this school, there are no class changes even after the[r]first year.[pcms]

*4785|
[fc]
That means there is a low possibility of other men knowing[r]about Saeki's smile.[pcms]

*4786|
[fc]
On the other hand, it means that I'll remain in a different[r]class from Yamagishi-san...[pcms]
